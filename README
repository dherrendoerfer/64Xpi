64Xpi readme file

64Xpi is a 6502 embedded runtime shim for a hardware 65C02 in the Raspberry Pi
You need a bad6502 board or something compatible to run it.

64Xpi integrates a seamles integration of the 6502 and its functions into the
Linux host operating system - you may never know it's there, and the 6502 doesn't care.

Polite warning:
This is work-in-progress - your mileage may vary.


How to:
-------

For now, C programs can be build using the CC65, CL65 compiler.
Configuration files, headers and examples are included. 
Assembler can also be used but the samples are not good ATM.


Architecture (really rough)
---------------------------

- The Rasperry Pi runns the 6502, generating clock and all bus/mem/signal lines.
- The 65C02 has no idea about anything.
- The runtime shim provides memory and io to the 6502.
- There are a number of ways the Pi and the 6502 share information
    - memory IO: certain memory addresses fetch information from the Pi (like the current time)
    - synchronous IO: the 6502 saves a request in memory and calls a special address.
      The Pi stops clocking the 6502 serves the request, and continues after depositing the
      response to the request to memory.
    - asynchronous IO: the 6502 saves a request to memory and places the address of that request
      into a mailbox. A second thread on the Pi serves the request and places the response in memory
      signaling completion. The 6502 has to actively poll for the completion, but it is never stopped.
- Using the above techniques, the 6502 gets access to library functions of the Pi, like files and
  terminal IO.
- Extended library calls add features like graphics, events, networking, paged memory.
- Using Linux binfmt_misc, the Pi integrates the 6502 binary format. Just execute what you wrote.
- The bad65OS Linux mini-distro integrates with VisualStudio Code directly for remote development.
(more to come)


Getting it to run:
------------------

Clone the project to a Raspberry Pi,

In the project home directory, issue 'make all'
This will build all the tools and test files.

Run './native/binfmt_misc/dev_64Xpi.sh'

Go to './native/C' and try the tests

Make install will install the 64Xpi launcher, tou need to add the binfmt_misc enabler to init.


Detailed Hardware and Software architecture (at the moment)
-----------------------------------------------------------
64Xpi simulates memory and additional memory-mapped hardware to the 65C02 on the bad6502 board.

depending on the code (Yes, you have to choose to enable hardware) you can have memory pages,
graphics access hardware, a timer and much more (work in process)

Program start
-------------
Execuatbles start at 1000
ARGC,ARGV[] start at 0900 

Program header
--------------
The program header identifies the 6502 binaries, and includes loader info for the execution shim.
(./native/binfmt_misc/add_hdr.sh adds it)
